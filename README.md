# Night of Chances Redesign

Night of Chances, commonly abbreviated as NoC, is an extensive annual event in Bratislava, Slovakia, designed to facilitate career networking, provide informative workshops, and engaging lectures. This full-day event is an excellent opportunity for students, professionals, and aspiring individuals to connect with industry experts, gain valuable insights, and explore potential career paths.

This repository simply contains code and styling that redesigns the event's landing page. Why? Because I like it event, but not their website (also, please remove smooth scrolling â€“ I'm yet to meet someone who thinks that's a good feature).
